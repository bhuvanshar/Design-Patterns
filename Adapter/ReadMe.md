Adapter Design Pattern

> Allows 2 incompatible interfaces to work together.
> Used when the client expects a (target) interface.
> The Adapter class allows the use of the available interface and the Target interface.
> Any class can work together as long as the Adapter solves the issue that all classes must implement every method defined by the shared interface.
